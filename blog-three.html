<strong>Web Libraries and Frameworks</strong><br><br>

By yourname:<strong> Patrick Ghold Camento</strong><br><br>

<strong>React</strong> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for 
building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a 
community of individual developers and companies.<br><br>

<strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like 
<strong>Next.js.</strong> Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, 
React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage 
of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary 
rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.<br><br>

<strong>Angular</strong><br><br>

<strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a <strong>TypeScript-based</strong>, free and open-source single-page web 
application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and 
corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.<br><br>

<strong>jQuery</strong><br><br>

In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still 
in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.<br><br>

<strong>Vanilla JS</strong><br><br>

The framework-like moniker "Vanilla JS" is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries 
or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
