<strong><h3>Understanding JavaScript</h3></strong><br>
By yourname: <strong>Patrick Ghold Camento</strong><br><br>

<strong>What is JavaScript?</strong><br><br>

<strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as<strong> JS,</strong> is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide 
Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
execute the code on users' devices.<br><br>

<strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript 
standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application 
programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data 
structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br><br>

<strong>The ECMAScript standard</strong> does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or 
graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br><br>

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some 
servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br><br>

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two 
languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<br><br>

<strong>Website Client-side Usage</strong>
JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for 
this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the 
DOM.<br><br>

All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.<br><br>




Examples of Scripted Behavior<br><br>
• Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For 
example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.<br><br>

• Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.<br><br>

• Playing browser games.<br><br>

• Controlling the playback of streaming media.<br><br>

• Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.<br><br>

• Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.<br><br>

• Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use 
this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.<br><br>

• Redirecting a user to another page.<br><br>

• Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.<br><br>
