        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>By Your Name:<strong>Patrick Ghold Camento</strong></p>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the presentation of a web page written in HTML or XML. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of a website. By using CSS, you can separate the content of a web page from its design, making it easier to maintain and update.<br><br>

<strong>Key Features of CSS:</strong><br><br>

<li>
  <strong>Selectors:</strong> Specify which HTML elements the styles should apply to.
</li>
<br><br>

<li>
  <strong>Properties and Values:</strong> Define how elements should look (e.g., color, font-size, margin).
</li>
<br><br>

<li>
  <strong>Cascading:</strong> 
  Determines which styles are applied when multiple rules affect the same element, based on specificity and the order in which the rules appear.
</li>
<br><br>

<li>
  <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> 
Allows the website to adjust its layout and appearance based on the screen size of the device.
</li><br><br>

<h4>
  <strong>Basic Example:</strong>
</h4>

<h4>css</h4>

<p>body {<br><br>
  background-color: lightblue;<br><br>
}

<br><br>h1 {<br><br>
  color: white;
  text-align: center;<br><br>
}

<br><br>p {<br><br>
  font-family: "Arial";
  font-size: 14px;<br><br>
}</p><br>


In this example, the body tag has a light blue background, h1 elements are white and centered, and p elements use the Arial font with a size of 14px.<br>

CSS is essential for modern web development, making websites visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>

        <h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
        <p>By Your Name:<strong>Patrick Ghold Camento</strong><br><br>

        JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, such as animated graphics, interactive forms, real-time content updates, and much more. Unlike HTML, which defines the structure of a web page, and CSS, which handles its styling, JavaScript controls the behavior of the web page.
      </p><br>

<strong>Key Features of JavaScript:</strong><br><br>

<li><strong>Client-Side Scripting:</strong> 
    JavaScript is most commonly used on the client side (i.e., in the user's web browser) to add interactivity to web pages without needing to reload the entire page.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong>
    Variables in JavaScript are not bound to a specific data type, meaning you can assign and reassign different types of data to the same variable.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Event-Driven:</strong> 
    JavaScript can respond to user actions like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements, making web pages interactive.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Asynchronous Programming:</strong> 
    JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, such as making API calls or handling timers, which allows the code to run without blocking other operations.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong>
 JavaScript supports OOP, enabling developers to create objects and classes for more organized and reusable code.
</li>

<h4><strong>Basic Example:</strong></h4>

// Change the content of an HTML element with the id "demo"
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello, World!";<br><br>

// Create a function that runs when a button is clicked
function showAlert() {
  alert("Button clicked!");<br>
}

<strong><h4>
  In this example:
</strong></h4>

<li>The first line changes the text inside an HTML element with the ID "demo" to "Hello, World!".</li><br>

<li>The second part defines a function that shows an alert box when a button is clicked.</li><br>

<strong>Common Uses of JavaScript:</strong><br><br>

<li><strong>Form Validation:</strong> 
  Ensure that user inputs meet specific criteria before submitting a form.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Animations:</strong> 
  Create visual effects like fading, sliding, or transforming elements on the page.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> 
  Load and display content dynamically without reloading the page (e.g., updating a list of search results as the user types).
</li><br>

<li><strong>Games and Applications:</strong> 
  Develop fully interactive games and web applications that run directly in the browser.
</li><br>
<p>
JavaScript is an essential part of modern web development, and it is supported by all major web browsers. With frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript can be used to build complex web applications and even mobile apps.

        <h3>What is a Web Framework?</h3>
        <p>By Your Name:<strong> Patrick Ghold Camento</strong></p>
      </li>
<p>      
A <strong>web framework</strong> is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that simplify the process of building and maintaining web applications. It provides a structured way to develop web projects by automating common tasks like routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, interacting with databases, managing sessions, and more.
</p><br>

<strong>Key Features of Web Frameworks:</strong><br><br>

<li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong></li>
   Frameworks provide reusable code components, allowing developers to focus on the unique features of their application rather than repetitive tasks.<br><br>

<li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong></li>
    Many frameworks come with tools to generate basic components (like models, views, and controllers) to speed up development.<br><br>

<li><strong>Security:</strong></li>
     Frameworks often include built-in security features to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.<br><br>

<li><strong>Routing:</strong></li>
     Frameworks map URLs to specific functions or classes, determining how web requests should be handled.<br><br>

<li><strong>Template Engines:</strong></li> 
    render dynamic content by merging backend data with HTML, allowing for easier separation of logic and presentation.<br><br>

<li><strong>Database Abstraction:</strong></li> 
    Many frameworks provide tools to interact with databases more easily, like Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), which map database tables to programming language objects.<br><br>

<strong>Types of Web Frameworks:</strong><br><br>

<strong>1:Front-End Frameworks:</strong> These focus on the client side (what the user interacts with) and help in managing the structure and behavior of web pages.<br><br>

<strong>Examples:</strong><br><br>

<li><strong>React:</strong></li> 
  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, often used for single-page applications.<br><br>

<li><strong>Vue.js:</strong></li> 
  A lightweight JavaScript framework for building UIs and single-page applications.<br><br>

<li><strong>Angular:</strong></li>
  A full-fledged framework for building large-scale client-side applications.<br><br>

<strong>2:Back-End Frameworks:</strong>
These focus on server-side logic, databases, and application business logic. They handle requests, interact with databases, and serve responses.<br><br>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<br>

<li><strong>Django (Python):</strong></li>
  A high-level framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.<br><br>

<li><strong>Express.js (Node.js):</strong></li>
  A lightweight framework for building web applications in Node.js.<br><br>

<li><strong>Ruby on Rails (Ruby):</strong></li>
  A convention-over-configuration framework for building web apps quickly and efficiently.<br><br>

<li><strong>Laravel (PHP):</strong></li>
  A PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and powerful tools.<br><br>

<strong>3:Full-Stack Frameworks:</strong>
  These frameworks cover both front-end and back-end development, providing tools for managing the entire stack.<br><br>

<strong>Examples:</strong><br><br>

<li><strong>Next.js (JavaScript/React):</strong></li> 
  A React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.<br><br>

<li><strong>Meteor (JavaScript):</strong></li> 
  A full-stack platform for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript.<br><br>

<li><strong>Spring (Java):</strong></li>
  A comprehensive framework for enterprise-level applications, focusing on back-end development but often integrated with front-end tools.<br><br>


<strong>Why Use a Web Framework?</strong>

<li><strong>Faster Development:</strong></li> 
  Frameworks provide ready-to-use components and tools, so developers can focus on writing application-specific code.<br><br>

<li><strong>Standardization:</strong></li> 
  They enforce a standard project structure, making it easier for teams to collaborate and maintain code.<br><br>

<li><strong>Community Support:</strong></li> 
  Most frameworks have large communities, meaning plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party plugins are available.<br><br>

<li><strong>Scalability:</strong></li> 
  Frameworks often come with features that make scaling the application easier as it grows in complexity or traffic.<br><br>
